# Computer Organization & Programming - Fall 2023
## Course Description
An introduction to basic computer hardware, machine language, assembly language, and C programming.

This course introduces you to the fundamentals of how computers work from both the hardware and software points of view. It serves as a “roadmap” for the rest of the computer systems courses that you will take here. After taking this course, you will have a better understanding of how a program is translated into commands for execution on hardware, and how the hardware executes those commands using, ultimately, electrons to do the work.
